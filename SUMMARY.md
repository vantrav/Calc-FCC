# Summary 
  
### Reinvent? Naa! 
 
* Kyoon (why)? 
* Aarya Bhatt Ji did that already,  
* JavaScript Math built-in functions are the focus (small steps, one at a time). 
* Ain't planning to launch a rocket here. 
* Basics, fundamentals of maths and JavaScript. 
* Working in a single threaded environment, so it is easy to follow the rules. 
* Chrome developer tools gives more insight to beginners while learning, use it.  
* On the way lot of tips and tricks to overcome common problems that JS offers to solve and giving learning base to take baby steps. 
* Knowledge gained from FCC, campers and other resources, involves fair amount of reading.
